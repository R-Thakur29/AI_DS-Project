# Plagiarism Detector using BERT Model

This project is a robust plagiarism detection tool that leverages the power of the BERT model for semantic text comparison. 
It supports multiple file formats, including text, PDF, and DOCX, and fetches web content to compare user input against potential plagiarism sources. 
The core functionality revolves around extracting embeddings from the text using BERT and calculating the cosine similarity between the embeddings to detect similarities. 
This tool provides highly accurate results by capturing both syntactic and semantic similarities in text, making it more efficient than traditional word-based approaches.

*Key Features:*
  1. Utilizes BERT tokenizer and model for contextualized text embeddings.
  2. Supports text, PDF, and DOCX file formats for input.
  3. Fetches web content to compare and detect plagiarism from online sources.
  4. Cosine similarity calculation for precise similarity measurement.
  5. Streamlit-based interface for easy use and interaction.
    
This project is ideal for detecting copied content from various sources with semantic understanding, making it a powerful solution for plagiarism detection.
